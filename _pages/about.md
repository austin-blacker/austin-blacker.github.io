# 👨‍🔬 About Me
I am a graduate student at the College of Life Science, Northwest A&F University, and I also obtained a Bachelor of Science degree from Northwest A&F University. I am a member of the National Key Laboratory of Crop Improvement for Stress Tolerance and Production, Shaanxi Key Laboratory of Agricultural and Environmental Microbiology. I am studying in Professor Shuo Jiao's Soil Health and Microbiome Team. 

_Only if you try your best can you claim your bad luck!_
